# Shishu 家 Launcher

This is a fork/rebrand of Lean Launcher made by hundeva (https://github.com/hundeva/Lean-Launcher)

This launcher is based on the o-mr1 version of Amir Zaidi's Rootless Pixel Launcher: https://github.com/amirzaidi/Launcher3/tree/o-mr1?files=1

The goal of Shishu 家 Launcher is to preserve the feeling of the Pixel Launcher and the options for customization from Lean, but rebranding it for our needs and make it a bit cleaner.

## Bug reports

Open an issue, with as much details as you can give, "the launcher crashed" is not going to cut it. Reproduction steps, adb logs, anything that you can provide helps.

## Feature requests

Open an issue, I will try to respond and see if it is something that I'm willing to do. No promises though. :)

##### Once again, special thanks to AmirZ for his excellent work. Without his project, I'm not sure Lean Launcher would ever born.
